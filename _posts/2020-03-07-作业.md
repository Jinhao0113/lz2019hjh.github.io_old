# The meaning of life and death

<h2>生死的含义</h2>

<!-- <table><tr><td bgcolor=black> -->

<font size = 4 color = "red" face = "monospace">

For life and death, first of all, we cannot talk about life and death. It is superficial and childish to talk about life and death from book experience without personal experience and from your family and responsibilities. Because the topic of death is not clear. Just like the meaning of life, fantasy can't be imagined. Only with personal experience can we understand.
Secondly, we cannot give up our lives at any time. Life is precious and fleeting. Anyone's life is worth cherishing, not being despised. We should treat our own and others' lives correctly. Life is like dew, death is not a terrible thing. We should have a peaceful heart to deal with death and existence.
Finally, the real death is forgotten. When no one in the world remembers you, you really disappear. The death of the body does not mean the disappearance of the spirit. When we leave the world and future generations can always remember us, we will die without regret, because this is the best result.

<h3>LIFE AND DEATH</h3>

As the day sprouts from night
So does life
spring from death 
As the day dilutes into night
Life slowly melts into death 
Even as the lightning flashes
Death bolts like
thunder, at times 
Colours of the universe, bright 
But dark are the rays of light 
See those fallen shadows there
Are the shadows false oflife ?
Is life light in motion?
Yonder truth no one knows
He who seeks shall find it sure 
From the book of future's life.

<h3>A POEMOF LIFE</h3>

The life is a risky journey
lt can be short as seed
Or tall as tree
Its beauty admirable
But pain is unbearable
You can feel it, spend it
But never can hold it
Have an end is death 
Death, when you stop taking breath
Then, you'd lose everything you have
Your body is just to show
Sooner or later decompose
Your soul is left all alone..
